## What

Ray is a set of general-purpose utilities distributed in C++23 that offers the following characteristics:

- Secure-based features.
- Tested features.
- Modern methodologies & patterns.
- Math driven.
- Fast in terms of runtime speed.
- Ease to implement/integrate & use.
- Comprehensive & empathic nomenclature & documentation.


## Why

All the other C++ general-purpose libraries fail to meet all the characteristics that Ray carries.

Therefore, Ray aims to cover these in a reliable & long-term manner.


## How to's

### Use

Ray seeks the plug&play philosophy, therefore, it's as easy as include the header file that contains the functionality you want to use.


### Read

Use a Markdown renderer to consume the documentation, preferably Obsidian with the community plug-in Editor Syntax Highlight installed & enabled.

If you're looking for the C++'s documentation of ``X.hpp``, then head to ``Documentation/X.md``, e.g:

1. If you want to consult the documentation of ``Core/Types.hpp``, head to ``Documentation/Core/Types.md``.
2. If you want to consult the documentation of ``Meta/Same.hpp``, head to ``Documentation/Meta/Same.hpp``.

If the feature or file you're looking for in the documentation, ain't documented, it's because its usage ain't meant for you.


### Contribute

Open a PR with the feature you would like to see in Ray and i will study the case.

Preferably, attach a description and some examples of such desired feature.


### Report an issue or bug

Open a PR explaining the casuistry and i will study the case.
